## Introduction
GitHub is a web-based hosting service used to host Git repositories. In computing, a repository or "repo" as defined by the oxford dictionary is a central location where data is stored. It is a very important tool for developers, software engineers as well as technical writers. It is extremely important to learn how Git and GitHub work. Usually, Git stores file locally on your computers but GitHub allows you to have an online location where your files and version history are stored. 

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is an online software development platform used for storing, tracking, and collaborating on software projects. It allows you and others to work on projects from anywhere in the world. It is used to interact with version control software like Git.

## Why Git?

Git is a distributed version control system. It is distributed in the sense that every contributor working on a team project has a copy (repo) locally on his or her computer. It's software that records versions or changes to your files. It allows you to recall specific versions of your files at any given time. Okay, here's an example. Let's say I run a website development agency, and then a young man reached out to my agency to help him design a website. After agreement from both parties, we started the project. We finished and sent him a link to his website. He looked at it and reached out to us to change a few things. After three rounds of reviews and changes, he decided to go with the first design, which means we have to start the whole coding process again. That would have been a very frustrating experience without Git. We'll just have to recall the first/original version of the project and deliver it to him. Now, that's why Git is important. So basically, Git allows you to work on new features without having to mess up the initial code.

## Git vs GitHub

Now, you understand what Git and GitHub are all about. Let's take a look at some key differences between them.

* **Introduction:**
GIT was first introduced in April 2005.
GitHub was first introduced in October 2007. The site was later developed in April 2008.
* **Ownership:** 
Git is maintained by Linux. 
GitHub is maintained by Microsoft.
* **Application:** 
Git is a command line tool. 
GitHub has a graphical user interface(GUI).
* **Storage:** 
Git is installed locally on the system for use and does not require the internet. GitHub can be accessed on the web. It needs an internet connection.

## Clone
Cloning in GitHub  means to download and duplicate the codes/files present in the repository. Before we begin, you should know some of Git basic commands.
Now, to clone a repo in GitHub, use the following order:
1. Head over to your GitHub profile.
2. Click the new icon.

3. Name your repo.

4. Add a Readme.md file and create.

5. Click the code icon, and copy the URL.

6. Now, head over to your terminal. use the command ``` git clone [paste the URL here] ```.
7. Finally, navigate into the repo using the command ``` cd [folder name] ```. In our case, it is ``` cd github```.

## Commits
Commits are safe points. Adding commits keeps track of your progress and modifications as you work.
To do a commit, use the following order:
1. Stage the files you want to commit. Staging files gives Git permission to track your files. To stage a single file, use the command ``` git add [file name] ```. To stage multiple files, use the command ```git add . ``` or ``` git add --all ```.
2. Commit the file/files. To commit, use the command ``` git commit -m "This is for messages" ```. The ``` -m "Adds a descriptive message" ```. 

You have successfully committed your file/files.

## Pull request
Pull request is a way to contribute/collaborate to a project.  
To do a pull request in GitHub, use the following order:
1. Fork the repo you want to make changes to. A fork is a copy of a repo.

2. Create fork.

3. Click the code icon, copy the URL, and head over to your terminal to clone it.

4. In your terminal, use the command ``` git clone [paste URL here] ```. Click Enter.
Your output is similar to this:

5. Navigate into the repository directory. Use the command ``` cd [Directory name] ```
6. Go to the project you wish to make changes to.
7. Save your changes, add them to the staging area, and commit. To add to the staging area, use the command ``` git add . ```. To commit, use the commmand ``` git command -m "" ```Leave a descriptive message about the changes between the quotation marks. Click Enter.
8. Push your changes back to the main branch. Use the command ``` git push origin main ```. Click Enter.
Your output is similar to this:
![](assets/pull%205.png)
9. Return to your GitHub account to verify the changes in the forked repo.
10. Click pull requests > New pull request.

11. Click create pull request.

12. Finally, leave a comment and create pull request.

And you have successfully created a pull request.


## GitHub Desktop vs. GitHub CLI

**GitHub Desktop** is a great tool for beginners who it difficult to navigate the command line interface. It offers beautiful and specific buttons for every Git command so that the need for the command is never felt. 

**GitHub CLI** is a terminal interface. The GitHub CLI allows you interact with your code, carry out tasks relating to pull requests, issues, and other GitHub tasks right in your terminal.

## Conclusion
Learning to use Git and GitHub can be overwhelming but it is a very rewarding skill. The purpose of this article is to help you understand the concept of Git and GitHub. Now, it is time to explore these things yourself. All the best!
