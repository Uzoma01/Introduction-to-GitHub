# Introduction to GitHub

## Introduction
GitHub is a web-based hosting service used to host Git repositories. In computing, a repository or "repo" as defined by the oxford dictionary is a central location where data is stored. It is a very important tool for developers, software engineers as well as technical writers. It is extremely important to learn how Git and GitHub work. Usually, Git stores file locally on your computers but GitHub allows you to have an online location where your files and version history are stored. 

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is an online software development platform used for storing, tracking, and collaborating on software projects. It allows you and others to work on projects from anywhere in the world. It is used to interact with version control software like Git.

## Why Git?

Git is a distributed version control system. It is distributed in the sense that every contributor working on a team project has a copy (repo) locally on his or her computer. It's software that records versions or changes to your files. It allows you to recall specific versions of your files at any given time. Okay, let me give an example. Let's say I run a website development agency, and then a young man reached out to my agency to help him design a website. After agreement from both parties, we started the project. We finished and sent him a link to his website. He looked at it and reached out to us to change a few things. After three rounds of reviews and changes, he decided to go with the first design, which means we have to start the whole coding process again. That would have been a very frustrating experience without Git. We'll just have to recall the first/original version of the project and deliver it to him. Now, that's why Git is important. So basically, Git allows you to work on new features without having to mess up the initial code.

## Git vs GitHub

Now, you understand what Git and GitHub are all about. Let's take a look at some key differences between them.

* **Introduction:**
GIT was first introduced in April 2005.
GitHub was first introduced in October 2007. The site was later developed in April 2008.
* **Ownership:** 
Git is maintained by Linux. 
GitHub is maintained by Microsoft.
* **Application:** 
Git is a command line tool. 
GitHub has a graphical user interface(GUI).
* **Storage:** 
Git is installed locally on the system for use and does not require the internet. GitHub can be accessed on the web. It needs an internet connection.
